# SAI Image Analysis Dashboard

**Streamlined visual interface for monitoring SAI's primary n8n workflow**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard specifically targets the management and analysis of the **"Sai-webhook-upload-image+Ollama-analisys+telegram-sendphoto"** workflow, which handles 99.9% of the SAI n8n system activity (4,893 of 4,895 total executions).

### Core Problem Solved
The native n8n UI is inefficient for daily operational tasks related to image processing workflows:
- ❌ Can't efficiently browse image execution history
- ❌ Hard to see actual images and analysis results together  
- ❌ Payload inspection is clunky for visual data
- ❌ No quick way to identify pattern failures
- ❌ Difficult to track analysis quality over time

### Solution: Focused Visual Dashboard
✅ **Image Gallery View**: Browse processed images with results  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events for new executions  
✅ **Efficient Caching**: Filesystem-based image cache at `/mnt/raid1/n8n/backup/images/`  
✅ **Simple Authentication**: Password-protected for public access  
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Handles base64 images from database efficiently

## 📊 Data Sources & Context

### Primary n8n Database Tables
- **`workflow_entity`**: Workflow definitions (37 total, 4 active)
- **`execution_entity`**: Execution lifecycle (4,895 total, 99.96% success rate)  
- **`execution_data`**: Runtime data with image payloads
- **`credentials_entity`**: 29 credential sets (Telegram, Ollama, etc.)

### SAI Workflow Specifics
**Target Workflow ID**: `yDbfhooKemfhMIkC`  
**Node Count**: 10 nodes  
**Execution Pattern**: Webhook-triggered (POST to `/e861ad7c-8160-4964-8953-5e3a02657293`)  
**Primary Flow**: Image Upload → Ollama Analysis → Telegram Notification  
**Success Rate**: 99.96% (4,892 successful / 4,893 total)  

### Integration Points
- **Ollama API**: `qwen2.5vl:7b` model for image analysis
- **Telegram Bot**: Multiple bot configurations for notifications  
- **Google Services**: Sheets, Drive for potential data storage
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `https://ai.altermundi.net/pipelines/e861ad7c-8160-4964-8953-5e3a02657293`

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Core (Days 1-5)
- [ ] Simple password authentication system
- [ ] PostgreSQL read-only connection with pooling
- [ ] Filesystem cache implementation at `/mnt/raid1/n8n/backup/images/`

- [ ] Image extraction and caching algorithm
- [ ] Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Days 6-10)  
- [ ] Thumbnail generation and caching
- [ ] Advanced filtering (date, status, risk level)
- [ ] Full-screen image viewer with analysis overlay
- [ ] Execution details modal
- [ ] Error pattern detection
- [ ] Basic export functionality

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Days 11-14)
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL configuration
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers
- [ ] Session management improvements
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and health endpoints
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Image Gallery** for image viewing

### Backend  
- **Node.js** with Express
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **PostgreSQL client** (pg) for database access
- **Sharp** for image processing and thumbnails
- **Express Rate Limit** for API protection
- **Helmet** for security headers
- **bcrypt** for password hashing

### Database
- **Read-only user** with restricted views
- **Connection pooling** (5-10 connections)
- **Two-phase queries** to avoid memory issues
- **No modifications** to n8n schema
- **Parameterized queries** for security

### Deployment
- **Direct Node.js** deployment via systemd service
- **HTTPS required** for public access
- **Nginx reverse proxy** with SSL termination
- **Health checks** at `/dashboard/api/health`
- **Filesystem cache** persisted on RAID at `/mnt/raid1/n8n/backup/images/`

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Database Access
- **Read-only user** with minimal privileges
- **Connection through existing n8n database**
- **No write operations** allowed
- **Query timeout limits** for safety

### API Security  
- **Password authentication** for browser access
- **Rate limiting**: 60 req/min general, 5 login attempts/15min
- **Input validation** with parameterized queries
- **Session management** with token expiration
- **HTTPS enforced** for production

### Image Handling
- **Base64 extraction** from n8n database (already stored)
- **Filesystem caching** to avoid repeated extraction
- **Thumbnail generation** for gallery performance
- **Lazy loading** to manage memory usage
- **Direct image URLs** instead of JSON embedding
